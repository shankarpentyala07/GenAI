1. What are Large Language Models? 
Ans: Large language models use deep learning to process and understand natural language on a massive scale.

2. What is an example of a potential task a generative AI application can help solve?
Ans: Creating a draft for an email is a generative AI task

3. What is the purpose of vector-based embeddings?
Ans: To represent semantic meaning of text tokens.
The embedding for each token consists of multiple numeric elements. Each element indicates the location of the word along a particular dimension, like coordinates on a map.

4. What is the potential impact of copilots?
Ans: Copilots can help with first drafts, information synthesis, strategic planning, and much more. Copilots have the potential to revolutionize the way we work

5. How are ChatGPT, OpenAI, and Azure OpenAI related?
Ans: OpenAI is a research company that developed ChatGPT, a chatbot that uses generative AI models. Azure OpenAI provides access to many of OpenAI's AI models.

6. You would like to summarize a paragraph of text. Which generative AI model family would you use to solve for this workload?
Ans: GPT

7.  What is one action Microsoft takes to support ethical AI practices in Azure OpenAI?
Ans: Provides Transparency Notes that share how technology is built and asks users to consider its implications.

8. Why should you consider creating an AI Impact Assessment when designing a generative AI solution?
Ans: An AI Impact Assessment guide documents the expected use of the system and helps identify potential harms.

9. What capability of Azure OpenAI Service helps mitigate harmful content generation at the Safety System level? 
Ans: Content filters enable you to suppress harmful content at the Safety System layer.

10. Why should you consider a phased delivery plan for your generative AI solution? 
Ans: An initial release to a restricted user base enables you to minimize harm by gather feedback and identifying issues before broad release.
