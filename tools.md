* Generative AI tools such as Open AI Codex, Microsoft Copilot, GitHub Copilot, TabNine, and Kite, generate boilerplate code, suggest code completions for repetitive code segments or generate code snippets from natural language prompts. 
* Visual Studio Live Share creates pair programming sessions in which the tool acts as a coding partner to help catch errors in real time. 
* Diffblue Cover generates test cases for more extensive and efficient testing and checks documents, unit tests, and test data for bucks. 
* Sphinx generates documentation for code and systems based on natural language descriptions. 
* Rundeck, Ansible, and Terraform automate code for system administration, configuration management, user provisioning, security patching and other routine tasks.
* Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana identify patterns, anomalies, potential issues in system logs.
* Syntho, MDClone, Mostly AI, Sogeti and Hazy generate synthetic testing data for pre-training systems.
* Google AI Platform Vertex AI, Amazon SageMaker, and Microsoft Azure Machine Learning overcome data scarcity by training and testing AI models on synthetic data sets. They also generate code for data cleaning and pre processing tasks, and even suggest and generate features based on the data.
* H20 Driverless AI and DataRobot create interactive visual reports to communicate complex data insights.
* Jenkins, GitLab, CI/CD and CircleCI automate phases of CI/CD pipeline. For instance, they generate test cases to deploy applications automatically. They issue alerts and offer insights to improve monitoring and troubleshooting. They also suggest code to optimize infrastructure for Cloud based environments.
* Terraform automates the generation of IAC scripts, by using generative AI, DevOps engineers facilitate infrastructure management, automate testing and deployment, and accelerate the software release cycle.
