1. Fine-Tuning:
you can also use an existing model as a foundational model - a starting point for further training with your own data. This approach is called fine-tuning, and it enables you to train a custom model that builds on the pre-trained model, but which is tuned to data that is relevant for your particular scenario. For example, a legal firm might fine-tune a model with the text from existing contracts and other proprietary legal documents to train a model that is optimized for generating contractual content.

2. Inferencing: (predicting a new sequence of tokens)
